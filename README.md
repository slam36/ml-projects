# CS 7641 Machine Learning Projects

If you are here you are probably a TA or professor for cs7641 to look at my code. 

The spambase classification code and data files are in the spambase folder, and the letter recognition code and data files are in the letters folder. It is pretty self explanatory and intuitive.

All of the main code is in jupyter notebooks. There are some helper functions in .py files, but you should be able to just run the jupyter notebooks. All of the plots from the analysis report were taken directly from these jupyter notebooks.
