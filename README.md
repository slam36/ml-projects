# Exploring Supervised Learning Algorithms
I explored common supervised learning algorithms on two datasets: spambase and the letter recognition data set. The algorithms were decision trees, k-nearest-neighbors, support vector machines, and neural networks. I explored tuning the hyperparameters for each algorithm to see the effects of each one.


## File Structure

The spambase classification code and data files are in the spambase folder, and the letter recognition code and data files are in the letters folder. 

All of the main code is in jupyter notebooks. There are some helper functions in .py files, but you should be able to just run the jupyter notebooks. The jupyter notebooks also develop all of the plots.
